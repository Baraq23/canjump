## How the program works
For example; if the program is given the
unsigned integer slice:
 []uint{2, 3, 1, 1, 4}
 
then:
Position: 0  1  2  3  4
Steps:    2  3  1  1  4
          ^

// Starting from position 0, you have 2 steps to move forward. This means you will move to positions 2.

Position: 0  1  2  3  4
Steps:    2  3  1  1  4
                ^

// From position 2, you have 1 step, so you will move to position 3.

Position: 0  1  2  3  4
Steps:    2  3  1  1  4
                   ^

// Finally, from position 3, you have 1 step to reach the last index at position 4 confirming that it's possible so the output will be "True".

Position: 0  1  2  3  4
Steps:    2  3  1  1  4
                      ^
